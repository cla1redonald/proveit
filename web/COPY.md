## 6. Copy Principles

These are not copy strings — they are rules for any AI-generated copy that ProveIt itself outputs.

1. No emojis. Ever.
2. No exclamation points in UI chrome. ProveIt is direct, not enthusiastic.
3. Section labels are always uppercase and monospaced. They are not titles — they are labels.
4. Buttons use verb + noun in uppercase: "RUN FAST CHECK", "START VALIDATION", "DOWNLOAD SUMMARY".
5. Error messages state what happened and what to do. Not what went wrong technically.
6. Never say "Oops" or "Uh oh" or "Hmm". These soften errors and undermine the tool-like character of the product.
7. Use "ProveIt" (one word, capital P, capital I) — never "Prove It" (two words) or "proveit" (lowercase).
